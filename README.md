SupraHotFramework
====

# Notes
## Compiling for Android
The libSupraHotLib.so must be moved to this location: "x:\SupraHotFramework\Intermediates\SupraHotSandbox\Tegra-Android\Debug\libs\armeabi-v7a\" prior to compiling the sandbox app.
Otherwise it won't find the library on app start

# Supported platforms
## Windows
## Android
## mac OS (WIP)
+ WindowMac.cpp needs to be implemented
+ SandBoxApp.mm needs to be created
+ XCode project needs to be created. This will also help with compiling the lib for iOs
## iOS	(Comming after mac)
## Web	
+ This will eventually be done after all other builds are good to go.
